## Description
This app is to explore building a quiz style app in a computer browser utilising:
- firebase
- javascript
- react
- react-bootstrap
- codemirror
- heroku

## Context
I have an examination in January and so I want to be practicing tools that could help me in building my synoptic project within five days.

The context of this development, is to explore the use of these tools and whether they would be useful for me to build a web app.  

## Planning



## Deployment

The deployed version can be accessed via [this link](https://pure-forest-58835.herokuapp.com/). 

This code has been deployed using Heroku. I originally set it to be continuously deployed, but as I am still making multiple amends it meant that I exceeded the amount of times that Heroku could connect to GitHub without user input. I have therefore changed this back to manual. 

*If you receive an error page*, please refresh the URI. 

DISCLAIMER: Please note that this link works on the 10th December 2021, but will go to sleep after a certain number of weeks and therefore not be able to be accessed at a later date.
